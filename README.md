# Departmental-Budget-Analysis-Project-Excel-based
Comprehensive Department Annual Budget-Actual Expenditures and Variance Analysis
In this Excel project, I conducted a detailed financial analysis of monthly actual and budgeted cost data for various departments over the course of a year. The work involved several steps:
Raw Data Sheet: Actual and budgeted expenses were recorded by months.
Pivot Analysis: I summarized relevant data using pivot tables to reveal annual totals for each department (both actual and budgeted).
Annual Summary Sheet:
I provided a tabular comparison of annual budgeted and total actual expenses. And created comparative column charts summarizing this data.
I also created an annual Variance Analysis chart, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the entire year.
Detailed Departmental Analyses:
I assessed the extent to which each department exceeded its budget.
I examined possible reasons for departments that failed to budgetly success.
For departments that fell below budget, I analyzed whether this represented a success or a lost opportunity.

I see this project, which aims to contribute to both financial control and decision-making processes, as a comprehensive analysis not only in terms of identifying numerical differences but also in terms of understanding and interpreting the possible reasons behind these differences.
